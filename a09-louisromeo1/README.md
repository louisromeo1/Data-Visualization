## Notes
HTML and JavaScript project with the objectives of implementing the marching squares algorithm for extracting isocontours in a piecewise manner, utilizing a case-table structure to maintain repeated computational structure and develop the algorithm in a compact way, further practice in using SVG paths and d3â€™s features for constructing them and experimenting with visual encoding of scalar fields utilizing both isocontour outlines and filled isocontours.
