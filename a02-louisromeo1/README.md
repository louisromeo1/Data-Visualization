## Notes

This program is designed to teach using Javascript to manipulate SVG objects so as to create a simple visualization. The objectives
for this assignment includes practicing and reviewing Javascript syntax for specifying SVG elements and their attributes, experimenting 
with the basics of enumerable types and higher order functions in Javascript, using these tools to generate simple visualizations of a dataset,
and developing these visualizations through the paradigm of mapping data elements to visual elements by implicitly looping over the dataset with the specified attribute getters.
