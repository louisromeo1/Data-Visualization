## Notes
This project focuses on Implementing a parallel coordinates view suitable for viewing multi-dimensional datasets, experimenting with using SVG path types for drawing polylines, practicing interactions with a parallel coordinates plot, particularly through implementing click events for selection and d3.brushâ€™s for brushing and linking. Also designing callback handlers that support the above interactions of selection and filtering, and understanding the types of tasks that parallel coordinates are suitable for.
